The Adventure of Max

This is my attempt at trying to make a 2D python game that is inspired by the arcade version of the Zelda games. The cat is modeled and named after my cat Max.

The main premise of the game would be very different than the Zelda games. It was supposed to be a cat just doing cat things like breaking things like vases, finding knick-knacks to bring back to it's owner, exploring, napping, and eating. With the main goal just being breaking all things and finding knick-knacks along the way back to his house. But I'm not that skilled so I didn't get anything actually running. 

I drew all cat images and flower pot. Flower pot is in the monsters folder because it's one of the things that cat would be breaking along his journey.
